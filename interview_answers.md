    To ensure your data is secure you should implement protected routes that require authentication, create privateRoute components, implement HTTPS, and implement thorough testing.

3. Describe how web servers work.
    Web servers are either a computer that stores code for a website or a program that runs on a computer that stores that kind of code. The process starts with an IP address obtained by a local computer's web browser and makes a request to the web server for the complete URL. The server responds and sends the client the requested information/resources and then the web browser displays the website.

4. Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
    The CRUD acronym stands for "Create, Read, Update, Delete". "Create" stands for the POST method, "Read" stands for the GET method, "Update" stands for the PUT method, and "Delete" stands for the DELETE method.
